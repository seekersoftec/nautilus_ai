# Data

**Data Acquisition, Feature Engineering, and Selection**
* **Data:** Collect raw data from various sources.
* **Features:** Transform the raw data into a set of relevant features. This involves **feature engineering** (creating new features from existing ones, scaling numerical data, and encoding categorical variables) and **feature selection** (choosing the most impactful features to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance).

# Offline Model Training

* **Training:** Train a model offline on a designated training dataset.
* **Validation:** Evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation dataset to tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing model.
* **Testing/Backtesting:** Test the final model on a held-out test dataset to simulate its performance on unseen data. For time-series models, this is known as **backtesting**, where the model is trained on historical data (e.g., 2018-2022) and tested on a subsequent period (e.g., 2023-2025) to prevent data leakage.
* **Deployment:** If the model's performance meets the defined criteria, it is packaged and deployed to an online environment.

# Online Deployment and Monitoring

* **Deployment:** Deploy the model to a production environment where it can serve predictions to live users or systems.
* **A/B Testing:** A common practice after deployment is to use A/B testing to compare the new model's performance against the existing one (or a control group) in a live setting. This helps validate the model's real-world impact on business metrics.
* **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the deployed model's performance to detect issues such as data drift, model decay, or performance degradation. This ensures the model remains reliable and accurate over time.
